                <p>Air conditioning is the perfect way to keep temperatures comfortable in hot weather. One of the places that will benefit most from air conditioning is a school. During the summer, classrooms can overheat very quickly on hot days which results in reduced learning. When students are exposed to the hot weather it can reduce concentration, problem solving, social skills and more. A comfortable classroom environment is essential for learning.
                    <br><br>
                    Not only is a cool temperature important for learning but for health too. When anyone is exposed to hot temperatures for a long time it can lead to dehydration, heat stroke and more. Air conditioning is an essential for schools in hotter climates.

                <p>Further to the recent communication from Dps Agra Administration regarding traffic and security, we would like to thank sincerely all parents and carers who routinely show their passes to the guards when they enter the school grounds. The guards are following instructions from their line managers and they are entitled to support and co-operation from us all in the discharge of their duty.<br><br>Security in schools, although of supreme importance, can at times cause us all inconvenience. However, that small price is well worth paying, for everyone’s safety. I try to remember to say thank-you often to our guards, who not only watch over us all through the working day but also keep vigil over the premises throughout the night, every night, working in shifts. A number of parents have kindly taken the time to stop and remark that the guards do a super job; such thoughtfulness brightens everyone’s day.</p>
